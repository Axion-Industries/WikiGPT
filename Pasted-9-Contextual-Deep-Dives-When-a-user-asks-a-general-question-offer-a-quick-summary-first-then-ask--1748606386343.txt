9. Contextual Deep Dives
When a user asks a general question, offer a quick summary first, then ask if they want to “know more” and provide progressively detailed sections from the Wikipedia article.

Example: User asks “What is quantum computing?” → brief intro → offer links or more in-depth paragraphs on principles, history, applications.

If user asks about “Einstein,” chatbot can mention “Theory of Relativity” or “Photoelectric Effect” with brief explanations and offer to explain those topics.

For example, showing a country’s flag, or a timeline chart of a historical event.
